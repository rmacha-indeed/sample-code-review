Twitter basic functionality
A user can follow other users.
Your homepage will display all tweets from the people whom you are following.

Assume twitter allows users to mark a tweet as favourite.
Let's say twitter has a new page to display only favourite tweets i.e. favourite dashboard.
The MR is to build favourites dashboard from all the tweets the user is following.
